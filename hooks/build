# Build
# DEP 2/29/24: Pushing to the local registry can fail for PR from a forked repo.
# The original script I copied does the push to docker hub here, and makes
# the push script a no-op.  This is not ideal, but harmless with the 'this' tag.
#
# Unfortunately, when someone creates a PR from a forked repo, this
# push fails with a credential issue.  Probably a good idea for
# security, but also causes the build test to fail.
#
# I tried pushing to a repo on localhost, but this also fails for
# strange reasons (at least as of today).
#
# Fortunately, for some reason the build test works if we bounce through a file
# (awesome.tar).
#
# If anyone wants to change this in the future, be aware during
# testing.  The old behavior (pushing directly to docker hub) works
# just fine on a PR from a local branch.
